### Tasks:

* Create a GitHub account, and create your first repo with a license and readme file. Use your new account to login to Zenodo and preserve any GitHub repos. Connect with your ORCID profile too.

    * Push different data formats in GitHub (e.g. CSV, SVG) and see what happens.

    * Find a GitHub repo that a colleague has created. Make changes or comments collaboratively, and inspect the differences.

    * Tag the releases and backup to Zenodo.

* Create an OSF collaborative environment from data to publication.

    * Connect your OSF project to GitHub.

    * Upload any raw code, images, data, tables to project.

    * Obtain a DOI and ARK identifier for your project.

* Use PaperHive, PubPeer, or Hypothes.is to comment on (annotate) any research article of your choice.

    * Consider doing this as part of a regular preprint journal club.

* Create a ScienceOpen/Figshare collection on your favourite research topic.

* Begin a new article draft using an Overleaf template. Clone this article with GitHub.
